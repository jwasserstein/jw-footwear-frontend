- Add provision for adding multiple items at once to the cart
- Add order history
- Add ability to leave reviews/ratings
- Add input validation on <CheckoutPage> (add labels clarifying the required input format)
- Consider replacing the <CheckoutPage> state field with a drop-down

- Try to combine <CartItem> with <OrderItem>.  The only difference is <OrderItem> doesn't have the remove button
